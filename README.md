# Difference-from-Control Test in R

This chapter is part of a larger book project on sensory evaluation using R. It focuses on the **difference-from-control test**, a discriminative method used to determine whether test samples differ significantly from a control sample.

## 📄 Contents

- Overview of the difference-from-control test
- Example using wheat bread with two recipe variants
- R code for data analysis using ANOVA and Dunnett’s test
- Practical notes for working with sensory data in R

The data consists of texture ratings from 30 panelists who evaluated three bread types: a control, Recipe A (increased water), and Recipe B (new yeast strain).
